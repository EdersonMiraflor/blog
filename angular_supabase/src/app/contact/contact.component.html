            <p class="text-gray-300">
                Welcome to my OJT Blog! This blog serves as my personal journal throughout my On-the-Job Training (OJT) 
                journey, where I document every step of my experience—my tasks, challenges, achievements, and learnings. 
                As a trainee stepping into the professional world, I aim to create a space that not only records my daily 
                activities but also reflects my growth, skills development, and the valuable lessons I acquire along the way.

            <p class="text-gray-300">
                The main purpose of this blog is to document my OJT experience in a structured and reflective manner. 
                By maintaining this blog, I can track my progress, recognize my strengths, and identify areas for improvement. 
                More than just a requirement, this serves as a personal record of my hard work and dedication.

            <p class="text-gray-300">
                Each blog entry includes a summary of my daily activities, highlighting key tasks and responsibilities 
                assigned to me. I also share the challenges I encountered and how I overcame them, whether through teamwork, 
                guidance from mentors, or independent problem-solving.
